This Earth Sciences laboratory, which was initially working on the lithosphere, has expanded towards the Environmental Sciences by focusing the main themes on Earth Sciences. It has an original approach in that it focuses on processes that simultaneously integrate the geosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere, at all spatial scales (nm to 1000 km), and from the current year to billions of years. The approach that gathers the laboratory revolves around observation, quantification, experimentation and modeling. Geosciences Rennes is one of the founding and driving units of the Earth Sciences and Astronomy Observatory in Rennes (OSUR). Important geological collections from the old Natural history museum of the city closed in 1944 and from the Faculty of Sciences are deposited in the Museum of geology (University of Rennes), keeping nearly one million specimens.","organisation_homepage":["https:\/\/geosciences.univ-rennes1.fr\/"],"organisation_datasets":[{"dataset_key":"68e364c7-2e11-4fbd-9417-bbc4ce2d188a","dataset_title":"Collections pal\u00e9ontologiques de l'Universit\u00e9 Rennes 1","dataset_endpoints":"http:\/\/ipt.gbif.fr\/archive.do?r=geosciences_rennes_pal"}]}
