These genetic sources are maintained as seed lots in cold storage by INRA. Environmental data of natural population collection sites have been recorded. Natural populations have been assessed for functional and agronomical traits in common gardens, and have been qualified for cytological (ploidy level) diversity. These data have been used to determine the relationship between species habitat diversity and species trait and cytological diversity in some sub-genera(Sampoux and Huyghe, 2009). The environmental distribution of trait diversity within species has also been investigated (Sampoux and Badeau, 2009). Landraces and old cultivars have been assessed for agronomical and molecular traits together with recent cultivars in order to understand the impact of human breeding on diversity sown for agricultural and leisure purposes (Flajoulot et al., 2005; Sampoux et al., 2011). Seed lots maintained by INRA are available as genetic resource and diversity study material under demand.","organisation_homepage":["http:\/\/www.poitou-charentes.inra.fr\/"],"organisation_datasets":[{"dataset_key":"59d46416-34e8-4da6-8d6f-1e3fc7b1b88b","dataset_title":"The French National Collection of forage and turf species (grasses and legumes).","dataset_endpoints":"http:\/\/ipt.gbif.fr\/archive.do?r=brcforageturf"}]}
